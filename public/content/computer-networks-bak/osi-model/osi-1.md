title: Introduction to the OSI Model

## Historical background

- Developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984
- Created to address network interoperability challenges
- Response to proprietary networking solutions from vendors
- **Goal**: Enable different vendors' equipment to communicate

## O S I definition

Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model - A conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of networking and telecommunications systems into seven distinct layers.

## Core objectives

- Provide framework for network protocol design
- Enable interoperability between different vendors
- Simplify network troubleshooting and education
- Facilitate modular protocol development
- Standardize network communication functions

## Key principles

- **Layered Architecture**: Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Abstraction**: Upper layers don't need to know lower layer details
- **Modularity**: Changes in one layer don't affect others
- **Standardization**: Common protocols and interfaces at each layer
- **Encapsulation**: Each layer adds its own header/trailer

## Benefits of layered approach

- Reduces complexity through functional separation
- Enables vendor independence and competition
- Promotes innovation within individual layers
- Simplifies troubleshooting with systematic approach
- Facilitates protocol standardization and development

## Zero Trust Principles

"Never trust, always verify" - fundamental security paradigm shift.

## Core Concepts

- **Identity-Centric Security**: Users and devices as perimeter
- **Least Privilege Access**: Minimal necessary permissions
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Granular network isolation
- **Continuous Verification**: Real-time security validation

## Traditional vs Zero Trust

- **Traditional**: Castle-and-moat security model
- **Zero Trust**: Assume breach, verify everything
- **Perimeter**: From network-based to identity-based
- **Trust**: From implicit to explicit verification

## Zero Trust Components

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
- **Privileged Access Management (PAM)**
- **Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)**
- **Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)**

## Network Micro-Segmentation

- **Software-Defined Perimeters**: Dynamic boundaries
- **Application-Level Segmentation**: Workload isolation
- **East-West Traffic Control**: Lateral movement prevention
- **Policy Enforcement Points**: Distributed security controls

## Zero Trust Implementation

- **Assessment Phase**: Current security posture
- **Architecture Design**: Security framework
- **Pilot Deployment**: Limited scope implementation
- **Gradual Rollout**: Phased expansion
- **Continuous Improvement**: Monitoring and optimization

## Technologies Enabling Zero Trust

- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN)**
- **Network Access Control (NAC)**
- **Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)**
- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**

## Benefits and Challenges

Benefits:
- Enhanced security posture
- Reduced attack surface
- Improved compliance
- Better visibility and control

Challenges:
- Complex implementation
- User experience impact
- Legacy system integration
- Cultural change management

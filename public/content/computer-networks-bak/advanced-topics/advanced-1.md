## S D N overview

Software-Defined Networking separates the control plane from the data plane, enabling centralized network management.

## Traditional vs  S D N

- **Traditional**: Distributed control plane in each device
- **SDN**: Centralized control plane with programmable interfaces

## Application layer

- Business applications
- Network services
- Orchestration platforms

## Control layer

- **SDN Controller**: Centralized brain
- Network operating system
- Global network view

## Infrastructure layer

- **OpenFlow Switches**: Programmable forwarding
- Flow tables and actions
- Statistical information

## S D N benefits

- **Centralized Management**: Single point of control
- **Programmability**: Custom applications
- **Flexibility**: Dynamic network changes
- **Cost Reduction**: Commodity hardware
- **Innovation**: Rapid service deployment

## Open Flow protocol

- Communication between controller and switches
- Flow-based forwarding
- Granular traffic control
- Match-action paradigm

## S D N use cases

- Data center networking
- Campus networks
- WAN optimization
- Network function virtualization

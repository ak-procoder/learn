## Circuit switching

- **Concept**: Dedicated path established for entire communication
- **Characteristics**: Guaranteed bandwidth, low latency
- **Examples**: Traditional telephone networks (PSTN)
- **Advantages**: Predictable performance, no congestion
- **Disadvantages**: Inefficient resource utilization, setup delay

## Packet switching

- **Concept**: Data divided into packets, each routed independently
- **Characteristics**: Shared resources, variable latency
- **Examples**: Internet, most modern networks
- **Advantages**: Efficient resource use, fault tolerance
- **Disadvantages**: Variable performance, potential congestion

## Message switching

- **Concept**: Entire message stored and forwarded at each node
- **Characteristics**: Store-and-forward mechanism
- **Examples**: Early telegraph networks, email systems
- **Advantages**: Simple routing, good for non-real-time data
- **Disadvantages**: High latency, large storage requirements

## Hybrid approaches

- **ATM**: Fixed-size cells combining circuit and packet benefits
- **MPLS**: Label switching for traffic engineering
- **Quality of Service**: Treating different traffic types differently
- **Virtual circuits**: Packet switching with circuit-like guarantees

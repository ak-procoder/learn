## Network management goals

- **Fault management**: Detecting and resolving problems
- **Configuration management**: Device setup and changes
- **Accounting management**: Resource usage tracking
- **Performance management**: Monitoring and optimization
- **Security management**: Access control and threat detection

## Management architectures

- **Centralized**: Single management station controls all devices
- **Distributed**: Multiple management stations with coordination
- **Hierarchical**: Management hierarchy with regional controllers
- **Peer-to-peer**: Devices manage each other cooperatively

## Management protocols

- **SNMP**: Simple Network Management Protocol
- **NETCONF**: Network Configuration Protocol
- **RESTCONF**: RESTful API for NETCONF
- **gRPC**: High-performance RPC framework

## Management information

- **MIB**: Management Information Base structure
- **OIDs**: Object identifiers for managed objects
- **YANG**: Data modeling language for NETCONF
- **Telemetry**: Streaming operational data

## Modern trends

- **Intent-based networking**: High-level policy specification
- **AI/ML in management**: Automated problem detection and resolution
- **Cloud management**: Centralized management of distributed resources
- **DevOps integration**: Network as code, CI/CD pipelines

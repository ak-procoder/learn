## C I A triad

The foundation of information security consisting of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

## Confidentiality

- Information accessible only to authorized users
- Encryption, access controls, authentication

## Integrity

- Data remains accurate and unmodified
- Digital signatures, checksums, hashing

## Availability

- Systems and data accessible when needed
- Redundancy, backups, DDoS protection

## Additional principles

- **Authentication**: Verify user identity
- **Authorization**: Grant appropriate permissions
- **Accounting**: Log and monitor activities
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevent denial of actions

## Defense in depth

- Multiple layers of security controls
- Physical, network, host, application, data layers
- Redundant protection mechanisms
- Fail-safe design principles

## Risk management

- Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
- Risk assessment and analysis
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Residual risk acceptance

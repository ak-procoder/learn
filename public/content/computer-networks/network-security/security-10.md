## Introduction to Virtual Private Networks

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) are secure communication technologies that create encrypted tunnels over public networks, allowing private data transmission as if users were directly connected to a private network. VPNs are essential for secure remote access, site-to-site connectivity, and protecting data privacy.

### Core VPN Concepts

## VPN Protocols and Technologies

### IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)
Comprehensive framework for securing IP communications.

#### IPSec Architecture
**Security Associations (SA):**

- **Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)**: Provides encryption and authentication
- **Internet Key Exchange (IKE)**: Manages security associations and keys

#### IPSec Modes
**Transport Mode:**
- Encrypts only the payload of IP packets
- Original IP headers remain unencrypted
- Used for end-to-end communication
- Suitable for host-to-host communications

**Tunnel Mode:**
- Encrypts entire original IP packet
- New IP header added for routing
- Used for network-to-network communication
- Standard mode for site-to-site VPNs

#### IPSec Implementation
**Configuration Parameters:**
- **Encryption Algorithms**: AES, 3DES, DES
- **Authentication Algorithms**: SHA-1, SHA-2, MD5

- Mutual authentication of VPN endpoints
- Agreement on encryption and authentication methods
- Generation of shared secrets for Phase 2

**Phase 2 (IPSec):**
- Negotiation of security associations for data transfer
- Agreement on encryption and authentication for user data
- Establishment of tunnel for secure data transmission
- Periodic renegotiation of security parameters

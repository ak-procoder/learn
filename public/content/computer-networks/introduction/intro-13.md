## Security threats

- **Eavesdropping**: Unauthorized interception of data
- **Data modification**: Alteration of transmitted information
- **Identity spoofing**: Impersonation of legitimate users/devices
- **Denial of service**: Preventing legitimate network access

## Security services

- **Confidentiality**: Protecting data from unauthorized disclosure
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data hasn't been modified
- **Authentication**: Verifying identity of communicating parties
- **Non-repudiation**: Preventing denial of actions

## Security mechanisms

- **Encryption**: Symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (RSA) algorithms
- **Digital signatures**: Ensuring authenticity and integrity
- **Access control**: User authentication and authorization
- **Firewalls**: Network traffic filtering and monitoring

## Network security layers

- **Physical**: Securing cables, equipment, facilities
- **Data link**: MAC address filtering, port security
- **Network**: IP filtering, VPNs, network segmentation
- **Transport**: SSL/TLS encryption, port-based security

## Best practices

- **Defense in depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Principle of least privilege**: Minimum necessary access
- **Regular updates**: Security patches and firmware updates
- **Security awareness**: User education and training

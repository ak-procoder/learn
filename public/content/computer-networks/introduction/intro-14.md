## Hierarchical design

- **Access layer**: End-user connectivity and access control
- **Distribution layer**: Policy enforcement and traffic aggregation
- **Core layer**: High-speed backbone connectivity
- **Benefits**: Scalability, manageability, fault isolation

## Redundancy and reliability

- **Link redundancy**: Multiple paths between devices
- **Device redundancy**: Backup equipment and hot standby
- **Geographic redundancy**: Distributed data centers
- **Recovery time objectives**: RTO and RPO planning

## Scalability considerations

- **Horizontal scaling**: Adding more devices/links
- **Vertical scaling**: Upgrading device capabilities
- **Modular design**: Expandable network architecture
- **Future growth**: Planning for capacity increases

## Performance optimization

- **Bandwidth planning**: Adequate capacity for traffic loads
- **Quality of Service**: Traffic prioritization and shaping
- **Load balancing**: Distributing traffic across resources
- **Caching strategies**: Reducing latency and bandwidth usage

## Cost considerations

- **CAPEX**: Initial equipment and installation costs
- **OPEX**: Ongoing operational and maintenance costs
- **Total cost of ownership**: Lifecycle cost analysis
- **Cost-benefit analysis**: ROI of network investments

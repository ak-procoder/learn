## Overview of Routing Protocols

Routing protocols are the fundamental communication mechanisms that enable routers in a network to share information about network topology, determine optimal paths for data transmission, and automatically adapt to network changes. These protocols form the backbone of modern internet infrastructure, ensuring that data packets can travel efficiently from source to destination across complex, interconnected networks spanning the globe.

### What are Routing Protocols?
Routing protocols are sets of rules and procedures that routers use to communicate with each other, exchange routing information, and maintain routing tables. These protocols enable routers to:
- Discover network topology and available paths
- Calculate optimal routes based on various metrics
- Share routing information with neighboring routers
- Adapt to network changes such as link failures or new connections
- Maintain consistent routing tables across the network

### Importance in Modern Networks
In today's interconnected world, routing protocols are essential for:
- **Internet Connectivity**: Enabling global internet communication across millions of networks
- **Enterprise Networks**: Connecting branch offices, data centers, and remote locations
- **Service Provider Networks**: Managing traffic for internet service providers and telecommunications companies
- **Cloud Computing**: Facilitating communication between cloud services and on-premises infrastructure
- **IoT and Edge Computing**: Supporting the growing number of connected devices and edge computing deployments

### Historical Context and Evolution

## Fundamental Concepts

### Routing vs. Forwarding
Understanding the distinction between routing and forwarding is crucial:

**Routing (Control Plane):**
- Process of determining the best path through the network
- Involves building and maintaining routing tables
- Exchanges routing information between routers
- Makes decisions based on network topology and metrics
- Typically handled by the router's CPU and control software

**Forwarding (Data Plane):**
- Process of moving packets from input interface to output interface
- Uses pre-computed routing table entries
- High-speed hardware-based packet processing
- Applies quality of service and traffic shaping policies
- Optimized for packet throughput and low latency

### Network Topology Concepts
**Physical Topology:**
- Actual physical connections between network devices
- Includes cables, wireless links, and infrastructure components
- Determines the possible paths for data transmission
- Influences network performance and reliability

**Logical Topology:**
- Conceptual view of how data flows through the network
- May differ from physical topology due to routing policies
- Influenced by routing protocol algorithms and administrative policies
- Can be modified without changing physical infrastructure

**Network Hierarchies:**
- **Core Networks**: High-speed backbone infrastructure
- **Distribution Networks**: Regional or metropolitan networks
- **Access Networks**: End-user connection points
- **Edge Networks**: Border between different administrative domains

### Autonomous Systems (AS)
**Definition and Purpose:**
- An autonomous system is a collection of IP networks under a single administrative control
- Uses a unique Autonomous System Number (ASN) for identification
- Implements consistent routing policies within the AS
- Provides a unit of routing policy and administrative control

**Types of Autonomous Systems:**
- **Stub AS**: Connected to only one other AS, typically customer networks
- **Multi-homed AS**: Connected to multiple ASes but doesn't provide transit
- **Transit AS**: Provides transit services, allowing traffic to pass through
- **Internet Exchange Point (IXP)**: Facilitates interconnection between multiple ASes

**Intra-AS vs. Inter-AS Routing:**
- **Intra-AS (Interior Gateway Protocols)**: Routing within a single AS using protocols like OSPF, RIP, or EIGRP
- **Inter-AS (Exterior Gateway Protocols)**: Routing between different ASes using protocols like BGP

## Classification of Routing Protocols

## Routing Metrics and Path Selection

### Common Routing Metrics

#### Hop Count
**Definition and Usage:**
- Number of routers a packet must traverse to reach destination
- Simple metric used by distance-vector protocols
- Each router along the path adds one to the hop count
- Maximum hop count limits prevent infinite loops

**Advantages:**

- Minimal computational requirements
- Effective for simple network topologies

**Disadvantages:**
- Doesn't consider link bandwidth or quality
- May select suboptimal paths in complex networks
- Limited scalability (typically 15-hop maximum for RIP)

#### Bandwidth
**Definition and Usage:**
- Available bandwidth or capacity of network links
- Higher bandwidth links preferred for routing
- Can be measured in bits per second (bps) or as relative values
- Often combined with other metrics for comprehensive path selection

**Implementation Considerations:**
- May use inverse of bandwidth (cost increases as bandwidth decreases)
- Static configuration or dynamic measurement
- Consideration of committed vs. available bandwidth

#### Delay (Latency)
**Definition and Usage:**
- Time required for packet to traverse a network link
- Includes propagation delay, transmission delay, and processing delay
- Critical for real-time applications like voice and video
- Can be measured or estimated based on link characteristics

**Types of Delay:**
- **Propagation Delay**: Time for signal to travel across the medium

### Composite Metrics
**EIGRP Composite Metric:**
```
Metric = [K1 × Bandwidth + (K2 × Bandwidth)/(256 - Load) + K3 × Delay] × [K5/(Reliability + K4)]
```

Where K1-K5 are weighting constants that can be adjusted based on network requirements.

- Higher bandwidth usage for updates

#### Counting to Infinity Solutions
**Maximum Hop Count:**

- Treats routes exceeding maximum as unreachable
- Simple implementation but limits network diameter
- May not prevent all types of loops

**Triggered Updates:**

- Faster propagation of topology changes
- Reduces probability of temporary loops
- Requires reliable update delivery

#### Hold-Down Timers
**Purpose and Operation:**

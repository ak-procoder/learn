## Description

Essential tools and methodologies for diagnosing and resolving TCP/IP network issues.

## Troubleshooting methodology

- 1. Define the problem clearly
- 2. Gather information about symptoms
- 3. Consider possible causes
- 4. Create action plan
- 5. Implement solution
- 6. Test and verify results
- 7. Document the resolution

## Network diagnostic tools

- **ping**: Basic connectivity testing
- **traceroute/tracert**: Path analysis
- **nslookup/dig**: DNS troubleshooting
- **netstat**: Network connections
- **tcpdump/Wireshark**: Packet capture
- **arp**: Address resolution table
- **route**: Routing table display

## Layered troubleshooting approach

- **Layer 1**: Physical connectivity
- **Layer 2**: Switch/VLAN issues
- **Layer 3**: IP addressing/routing
- **Layer 4**: Port/service availability
- **Layer 7**: Application problems

## Common connectivity issues

- Wrong IP address/subnet mask
- Incorrect default gateway
- DNS server problems
- Firewall blocking traffic
- Physical/link layer issues
- Routing table problems

## Advanced diagnostic techniques

- Packet capture analysis
- Performance monitoring
- Bandwidth utilization testing
- Latency and jitter measurement
- Application response time analysis
- Security event correlation

## Network monitoring tools

- SNMP-based monitoring
- Flow-based analysis (NetFlow)
- Synthetic transaction monitoring
- Real user monitoring (RUM)
- Infrastructure health monitoring
- Alert and notification systems

## Best practices

- Maintain network documentation
- Implement consistent naming
- Use network monitoring tools
- Regular backup of configurations
- Change management processes
- Staff training and certification

## Troubleshooting checklist

- ✓ Verify physical connectivity
- ✓ Check IP configuration
- ✓ Test local network connectivity
- ✓ Verify gateway accessibility
- ✓ Test DNS resolution
- ✓ Check routing tables
- ✓ Analyze firewall rules

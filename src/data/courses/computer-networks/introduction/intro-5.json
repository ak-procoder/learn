    "Personal Area Network (PAN)": [
      "Range: 1-10 meters around an individual",
      "Technologies: Bluetooth, USB, FireWire, Zigbee",
      "Applications: Smartphone to smartwatch, laptop to mouse",
      "Characteristics: Low power, short range, personal devices"
    ],
    "Local Area Network (LAN)": [
      "Range: Building or campus (up to a few kilometers)",
      "Technologies: Ethernet, WiFi (802.11), Token Ring",
      "Applications: Office networks, home networks, school labs",
      "Characteristics: High speed, low latency, shared resources"
    ],
    "Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)": [
      "Range: City or metropolitan area (10-50 km)",
      "Technologies: Fiber optic, cable TV networks, WiMAX",
      "Applications: City-wide WiFi, cable internet, metro Ethernet",
      "Characteristics: Medium speed, moderate latency"
    ],
    "Wide Area Network (WAN)": [
      "Range: Country, continent, or global",
      "Technologies: MPLS, Frame Relay, ATM, satellite",
      "Applications: Internet backbone, corporate networks",
      "Characteristics: Variable speed, higher latency, expensive"

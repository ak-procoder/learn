  "content": {
    "physical vs logical topology": [
      "Physical: How devices are physically connected with cables",
      "Logical: How data flows through the network",
      "May differ: Ethernet uses physical star, logical bus",
      "Important for: Network design and troubleshooting"
    ],
    "bus topology": [
      "Structure: Single cable backbone with all devices connected",
      "Advantages: Simple, cost-effective, easy to implement",
      "Disadvantages: Single point of failure, performance degrades",
      "Applications: Early Ethernet (10BASE2), small networks"
    ],
    "star topology": [
      "Structure: Central hub/switch with devices connected radially",
      "Advantages: Easy troubleshooting, fault tolerance, scalable",
      "Disadvantages: Central point dependency, more cable required",
      "Applications: Modern Ethernet, most office networks"
    ],
    "ring topology": [
      "Structure: Devices connected in circular fashion",
      "Advantages: Equal access, predictable performance",
      "Disadvantages: Single break affects entire network",
      "Applications: Token Ring, FDDI, some MANs"
    ],
    "mesh topology": [
      "Structure: Multiple paths between devices",
      "Full mesh: Every device connected to every other",
      "Partial mesh: Some devices have multiple connections",
      "Applications: Internet backbone, fault-critical networks"

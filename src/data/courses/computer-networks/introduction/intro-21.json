    "QoS fundamentals": [
      "Definition: Providing different levels of service to different traffic",
      "Purpose: Ensure critical applications receive adequate resources",
      "Metrics: Bandwidth, latency, jitter, packet loss",
      "Applications: Voice, video, business-critical data"
    ],
    "traffic characteristics": [
      "Voice traffic: Low latency, low jitter, moderate bandwidth",
      "Video traffic: High bandwidth, moderate latency, low jitter",
      "Data traffic: Variable requirements, often bursty",
      "Background traffic: Low priority, best-effort delivery"
    ],
    "QoS mechanisms": [
      "Classification: Identifying and marking traffic types",
      "Policing: Enforcing traffic rate limits",
      "Shaping: Smoothing traffic bursts",
      "Scheduling: Determining transmission order"
    ],
    "QoS models": [
      "Best effort: No guarantees, treat all traffic equally",
      "Integrated services: Per-flow resource reservations",
      "Differentiated services: Class-based service levels",
      "Traffic engineering: Path optimization for better performance"
    ],
    "implementation challenges": [
      "End-to-end guarantees: Coordination across multiple networks",
      "Scalability: Managing QoS for millions of flows",
      "Fairness: Balancing different users' needs",

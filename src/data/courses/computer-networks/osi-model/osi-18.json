  "content": {
    "UDP characteristics": [
      "Connectionless: No session establishment required",
      "Unreliable: No delivery guarantees",
      "Fast: Minimal overhead and processing",
      "Message-oriented: Preserves message boundaries",
      "No flow control: Sender transmits at any rate",
      "No congestion control: Network congestion not managed"
    ],
    "UDP header structure": [
      "Source Port: 16 bits (sending application)",
      "Destination Port: 16 bits (receiving application)",
      "Length: 16 bits (UDP header + data)",
      "Checksum: 16 bits (optional error detection)",
      "Total header size: Only 8 bytes (vs 20+ for TCP)"
    ],
    "UDP advantages": [
      "Lower overhead: Smaller headers and no state",
      "Faster transmission: No connection setup/teardown",
      "Broadcast/multicast support: One-to-many communication",
      "Real-time applications: No retransmission delays",
      "Simple implementation: Less complex than TCP"
    ],
    "UDP applications": [
      "DNS: Domain Name System queries",
      "DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol",
      "SNMP: Simple Network Management Protocol",
      "Video streaming: Real-time media delivery",
      "Online gaming: Low-latency interactive applications",
      "VoIP: Voice over IP communications"
    ],
    "when to use UDP": [
      "Speed more important than reliability",
      "Application handles its own error recovery",
      "One-to-many communication required",
      "Real-time constraints exist",
      "Simple request-response transactions"
    ]

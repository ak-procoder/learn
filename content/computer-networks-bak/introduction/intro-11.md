## What are protocols

- **Definition**: Set of rules governing communication between devices
- **Purpose**: Ensure reliable, orderly data exchange
- **Components**: Syntax (format), Semantics (meaning), Timing
- **Examples**: HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet, WiFi

## Protocol characteristics

- **Layered structure**: Each layer has specific responsibilities
- **Encapsulation**: Each layer adds its own header
- **Standardization**: Ensures interoperability between vendors
- **Error handling**: Detection and correction mechanisms

## Standards organizations

- **IEEE**: Ethernet, WiFi standards (802.3, 802.11)
- **IETF**: Internet protocols (TCP/IP, HTTP, SMTP)
- **ITU**: Telecommunications standards (X.25, ISDN)
- **ISO**: OSI model, various networking standards

## Key protocol families

- **TCP/IP suite**: Internet protocol stack
- **OSI protocols**: Theoretical seven-layer model
- **Ethernet family**: LAN protocols (802.3 variants)
- **Wireless protocols**: WiFi (802.11), Bluetooth, cellular

## Standardization benefits

- **Interoperability**: Different vendors' equipment works together
- **Competition**: Multiple suppliers drive innovation and cost reduction
- **Reliability**: Proven protocols reduce development risks
- **Scalability**: Standards support network growth

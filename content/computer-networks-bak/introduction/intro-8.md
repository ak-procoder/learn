## Client-server architecture

- **Structure**: Centralized servers provide services to clients
- **Advantages**: Centralized control, security, resource management
- **Disadvantages**: Single point of failure, server bottleneck
- **Applications**: Web services, email systems, databases

## Peer-to-peer ( P2 P) architecture

- **Structure**: Devices act as both clients and servers
- **Advantages**: Decentralized, scalable, fault tolerant
- **Disadvantages**: Security challenges, inconsistent performance
- **Applications**: File sharing, blockchain, video conferencing

## Hybrid architecture

- **Structure**: Combines client-server and P2P elements
- **Examples**: Skype (central authentication, P2P communication)
- **Benefits**: Leverages advantages of both models
- **Applications**: Many modern distributed systems

## Cloud architecture

- **Structure**: Services delivered over the internet
- **Types**: Public, private, hybrid, multi-cloud
- **Benefits**: Scalability, cost efficiency, accessibility
- **Challenges**: Internet dependency, data privacy

## Virtualization fundamentals

- **Definition**: Abstracting physical network resources
- **Purpose**: Flexibility, isolation, resource optimization
- **Benefits**: Reduced costs, simplified management, rapid deployment
- **Challenges**: Complexity, performance overhead, security

## Virtual  L A Ns ( V L A Ns)

- **Concept**: Logical segmentation of physical networks
- **Benefits**: Broadcast domain control, security isolation
- **Implementation**: IEEE 802.1Q tagging
- **Applications**: Department separation, guest networks

## Virtual private networks ( V P Ns)

- **Concept**: Secure tunnels over public networks
- **Types**: Site-to-site, remote access, client-to-site
- **Protocols**: IPSec, SSL/TLS, PPTP, L2TP
- **Applications**: Remote work, branch connectivity

## Network function virtualization ( N F V)

- **Concept**: Network services as software
- **Benefits**: Flexibility, cost reduction, rapid deployment
- **Examples**: Virtual firewalls, load balancers, routers
- **Challenges**: Performance, reliability, management

## Software-defined networking ( S D N)

- **Concept**: Centralized network control plane
- **Benefits**: Programmability, agility, centralized management
- **Components**: Controller, southbound/northbound APIs
- **Applications**: Data centers, campus networks, WANs

type: text

## Description

Understanding IPv4 address exhaustion and the technologies developed to address this challenge.

## Address exhaustion problem

- IPv4 provides only 4.3 billion addresses
- IANA exhausted central pool in 2011
- RIRs exhausted their pools 2014-2019
- Exponential growth of internet devices
- Mobile devices, IoT explosion

## Contributing factors

- Classful addressing waste (pre-1993)
- Early large allocations to organizations
- Lack of initial conservation efforts
- Geographic distribution imbalances
- Reserved address blocks

## N A T ( Network  Address  Translation)

- Translates private to public addresses
- Many devices share one public IP
- Enables private network growth
- Breaks end-to-end connectivity model
- Creates NAT traversal challenges

## C I D R and conservation

- More efficient address allocation
- Variable-length subnet masks
- Route aggregation benefits
- Slowed but didn't solve exhaustion
- Better allocation policies

## I Pv6 transition

- 128-bit addresses (340 undecillion)
- Permanent solution to exhaustion
- Dual-stack deployment
- Translation mechanisms
- Gradual adoption process

## Address market

- Secondary market for IPv4 blocks
- Organizations buy/sell addresses
- Pricing based on supply/demand
- Regional transfer policies
- Documentation requirements

## Conservation techniques

- More aggressive NAT implementations
- Carrier-grade NAT (CGN)
- IPv4 address sharing
- Reclaiming unused allocations
- Efficient DHCP pool management

## Future outlook

- IPv4 prices continue rising
- IPv6 deployment accelerating
- Dual-stack remains necessary
- Legacy IPv4 support ongoing
- Eventually IPv6-only networks

## Network Incident Management Framework

Effective incident response requires structured processes, clear communication, and systematic root cause analysis to prevent recurring issues.

## Incident Response Process

### Incident Classification and Prioritization

**Severity Levels:**
- **Severity 1**: Complete service outage affecting all users
- **Severity 2**: Major service degradation affecting multiple users
- **Severity 3**: Minor service issues affecting few users
- **Severity 4**: Individual user issues or cosmetic problems

**Impact Assessment Matrix:**
```
High Impact + High Urgency = Severity 1
High Impact + Low Urgency = Severity 2
Low Impact + High Urgency = Severity 3
Low Impact + Low Urgency = Severity 4
```

**Priority Factors:**
- **Business impact**: Revenue and operational effects
- **User count**: Number of affected users
- **Service criticality**: Mission-critical vs. non-essential
- **Available workarounds**: Alternative solutions

### Incident Response Team Structure

**Roles and Responsibilities:**
- **Incident Commander**: Overall incident coordination
- **Technical Lead**: Technical troubleshooting coordination
- **Communications Lead**: Stakeholder communication
- **Subject Matter Experts**: Specialized technical knowledge
- **Management Liaison**: Executive communication

**Escalation Procedures:**
1. **Level 1**: Frontline support and monitoring teams
2. **Level 2**: Network engineering and system administration
3. **Level 3**: Senior engineers and architects
4. **Level 4**: Vendor support and external resources

### Initial Response Activities

**Immediate Actions (First 15 minutes):**
1. **Acknowledge the incident**: Confirm receipt and ownership
2. **Assess scope and impact**: Determine affected systems and users
3. **Establish communication**: Set up incident bridge and notifications
4. **Begin triage**: Identify immediate stabilization actions
5. **Document timeline**: Start incident log and timeline

**Incident War Room Setup:**
```bash
# Emergency response checklist
□ Incident bridge established
□ Key personnel notified
□ Monitoring dashboards displayed
□ Documentation tools ready
□ Communication channels active
□ Escalation contacts available
```

## Root Cause Analysis Methodologies

### Five Whys Technique

**Sequential Problem Drilling:**
1. **Why did the network outage occur?**
   - Because the primary router failed
2. **Why did the primary router fail?**
   - Because the power supply unit failed
3. **Why did the power supply fail?**
   - Because it overheated
4. **Why did it overheat?**
   - Because the cooling system was inadequate
5. **Why was the cooling system inadequate?**
   - Because routine maintenance was not performed

**Documentation Template:**
```
Incident: Network outage on 2024-01-15
Why 1: Router failure → Power supply failure
Why 2: Power supply failure → Overheating
Why 3: Overheating → Inadequate cooling
Why 4: Inadequate cooling → Missed maintenance
Why 5: Missed maintenance → Process gap
Root Cause: Lack of preventive maintenance process
```

**Problem Categories:**
- **People**: Human factors and training
- **Process**: Procedures and workflows
- **Technology**: Equipment and software
- **Environment**: Physical and external factors
- **Materials**: Documentation and resources
- **Measurement**: Monitoring and metrics

### Timeline Analysis

**Event Correlation:**
```
2024-01-15 14:30 - High CPU alerts on router
2024-01-15 14:35 - Temperature warnings
2024-01-15 14:40 - Cooling system alert
2024-01-15 14:45 - Power supply failure
2024-01-15 14:46 - Complete router failure
2024-01-15 14:47 - Network outage begins
```

**Contributing Factors Analysis:**
- **Immediate cause**: Power supply failure
- **Proximate causes**: Overheating, inadequate cooling
- **Root causes**: Missed maintenance, process gaps
- **Systemic issues**: Monitoring blind spots, training gaps

## Technical Root Cause Analysis

### Network Failure Analysis

**Layer-by-Layer Investigation:**
```bash
# Physical layer verification
show environment                    # Temperature and power status
show inventory                     # Hardware component status
show logging | include ERROR       # Error message analysis

# Data link layer analysis
show interfaces                    # Interface status and errors
show spanning-tree                 # STP topology and issues
show mac address-table            # MAC learning problems

# Network layer investigation
show ip route                      # Routing table analysis
show ip arp                        # ARP table issues
ping and traceroute               # Connectivity testing
```

### Performance Degradation Analysis

**Baseline Comparison:**
```python
# Performance analysis script
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def analyze_performance_degradation(baseline_data, incident_data):
    """Compare performance metrics before and during incident"""
    
    metrics = ['cpu_usage', 'memory_usage', 'bandwidth_utilization', 'latency']
    
    comparison = pd.DataFrame({
        'Baseline': baseline_data[metrics].mean(),
        'Incident': incident_data[metrics].mean(),
        'Deviation': ((incident_data[metrics].mean() - baseline_data[metrics].mean()) 
                     / baseline_data[metrics].mean() * 100)
    })
    
    return comparison
```

### Configuration Change Analysis

**Change Correlation:**
```bash
# Configuration change tracking
show archive                       # Configuration history
show configuration commit list     # Recent commits
diff running-config startup-config # Current vs. saved config
```

**Change Management Integration:**
- **Change requests**: Correlate with incident timeline
- **Approval process**: Verify proper authorization
- **Testing procedures**: Validate change testing
- **Rollback plans**: Assess rollback execution

## Post-Incident Activities

### Service Recovery

**Recovery Verification:**
1. **Functional testing**: Verify all services operational
2. **Performance validation**: Confirm normal performance levels
3. **User acceptance**: Validate user access and functionality
4. **Monitoring confirmation**: Ensure alerts are cleared

**Recovery Metrics:**
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Time from incident start to detection
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Time from detection to response start
- **Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR)**: Time from detection to full resolution
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time from incident start to service restoration

### Post-Incident Review (PIR)

**PIR Agenda:**
1. **Incident timeline review**: Chronological event analysis
2. **Response effectiveness**: Team performance assessment
3. **Root cause validation**: Confirm identified causes
4. **Action item identification**: Preventive measures
5. **Process improvements**: Procedural enhancements

**PIR Documentation:**

    # Most common root causes
    root_causes = Counter(incidents_df['root_cause'])
    
    # Time-based patterns
    hourly_pattern = incidents_df.groupby(incidents_df['timestamp'].dt.hour).size()
    
    # Severity trends over time
    severity_trends = incidents_df.groupby([
        incidents_df['timestamp'].dt.date,
        'severity'
    ]).size().unstack(fill_value=0)
    
    return {
        'common_causes': root_causes.most_common(10),

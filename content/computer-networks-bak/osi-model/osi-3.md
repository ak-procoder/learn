## Layer 1 definition

Physical Layer - The lowest layer responsible for transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium.

## Primary functions

- **Bit transmission**: Converting data bits to physical signals
- **Physical medium specification**: Cable types, connectors
- **Electrical interface**: Voltage levels, current, impedance
- **Mechanical interface**: Connector specifications, pin assignments
- **Functional interface**: Signal timing and synchronization
- **Procedural interface**: Sequence of events for transmission

## Bit representation

- **Digital signals**: Discrete voltage levels (0V = 0, 5V = 1)
- **Analog signals**: Continuous waveforms (sine waves)
- **Encoding schemes**: NRZ, Manchester, Differential Manchester
- **Signal modulation**: AM, FM, PM, QAM for analog transmission

## Transmission characteristics

- **Bandwidth**: Range of frequencies that can be transmitted
- **Attenuation**: Signal strength reduction over distance
- **Noise**: Unwanted signals that interfere with data
- **Distortion**: Signal shape changes during transmission
- **Interference**: External electromagnetic disturbances

## Synchronization methods

- **Asynchronous**: Each character independently synchronized
- **Synchronous**: Continuous stream with clock synchronization
- **Isochronous**: Guaranteed timing for real-time applications

## I Pv6 overview

IPv6 addresses the limitations of IPv4 with 128-bit addresses and enhanced features.

## Why  I Pv6

- IPv4 address exhaustion
- Improved security features
- Better quality of service
- Simplified header structure
- Native mobility support

## Key features

- **128-bit addresses**: 340 undecillion addresses
- **Hierarchical addressing**: Efficient routing
- **No NAT required**: End-to-end connectivity
- **Built-in security**: IPSec mandatory
- **Auto-configuration**: SLAAC support

## Address types

- **Unicast**: One-to-one communication
- **- Global unicast (2000**: 
- **- Link-local (fe80**: 
- **- Unique local (fc00**: 
- **Multicast**: One-to-many (ff00
- **Anycast**: One-to-nearest

## Address notation

- Hexadecimal separated by colons
- **Example**: 2001
- **Compression**: 2001

## Transition mechanisms

- Dual stack (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Tunneling (6to4, Teredo)
- Translation (NAT64)

## Introduction to Authentication and Authorization

Authentication and authorization form the foundation of access control in network security. These mechanisms ensure that only legitimate users can access network resources and that they can only perform actions they are permitted to perform.

### Core Concepts
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user, device, or service
- **Authorization**: Determining what authenticated entities are permitted to do
- **Accounting**: Recording and monitoring what authenticated users actually do
- **AAA Framework**: Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting working together

### Authentication vs Authorization
- **Authentication asks**: "Who are you?"
- **Authorization asks**: "What are you allowed to do?"
- **Sequential Process**: Authentication must succeed before authorization
- **Independent Systems**: Can be handled by different systems or protocols

## Authentication Fundamentals

### Authentication Factors
Different categories of evidence used to verify identity.

#### Something You Know (Knowledge Factor)
- **Passwords**: Most common form of authentication
- **PINs**: Numeric passwords for specific systems
- **Security Questions**: Personal information as backup authentication
- **Passphrases**: Longer, sentence-like passwords

#### Something You Have (Possession Factor)
- **Smart Cards**: Physical cards with embedded cryptographic chips
- **Security Tokens**: Hardware devices generating time-based codes
- **Mobile Devices**: Smartphones as authentication devices
- **USB Keys**: Hardware tokens that plug into computers

#### Something You Are (Inherence Factor)
- **Fingerprints**: Most common biometric authentication
- **Facial Recognition**: Camera-based identity verification
- **Voice Recognition**: Audio-based biometric authentication
- **Retinal Scans**: High-security biometric identification
- **Behavioral Biometrics**: Typing patterns and mouse movements

#### Something You Do (Behavioral Factor)

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Using multiple authentication factors to increase security.

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Combining two different authentication factors for enhanced security.

**Common 2FA Combinations:**
- Password + SMS code
- Password + authenticator app

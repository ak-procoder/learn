## Introduction to Intrusion Detection and Prevention

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are critical security technologies that monitor network traffic and system activities to detect and respond to malicious activities. These systems provide early warning of security threats and can automatically respond to prevent or mitigate attacks.

### Core Concepts
- **Intrusion Detection**: Identifying unauthorized or malicious activities
- **Intrusion Prevention**: Actively blocking or stopping detected threats
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous surveillance of network and system activities
- **Threat Response**: Automated and manual responses to security incidents

### IDS vs IPS Comparison
- **IDS**: Passive monitoring and alerting system
- **IPS**: Active blocking and prevention system
- **Deployment**: IDS operates out-of-band, IPS operates inline
- **Response**: IDS notifies, IPS blocks

## Types of Intrusion Detection Systems

title: Quality of Service (QoS) Introduction
type: text
---

## Qo S fundamentals

- **Definition**: Providing different levels of service to different traffic
- **Purpose**: Ensure critical applications receive adequate resources
- **Metrics**: Bandwidth, latency, jitter, packet loss
- **Applications**: Voice, video, business-critical data

## Traffic characteristics

- **Voice traffic**: Low latency, low jitter, moderate bandwidth
- **Video traffic**: High bandwidth, moderate latency, low jitter
- **Data traffic**: Variable requirements, often bursty
- **Background traffic**: Low priority, best-effort delivery

## Qo S mechanisms

- **Classification**: Identifying and marking traffic types
- **Policing**: Enforcing traffic rate limits
- **Shaping**: Smoothing traffic bursts
- **Scheduling**: Determining transmission order

## Qo S models

- **Best effort**: No guarantees, treat all traffic equally
- **Integrated services**: Per-flow resource reservations
- **Differentiated services**: Class-based service levels
- **Traffic engineering**: Path optimization for better performance

## Implementation challenges

- **End-to-end guarantees**: Coordination across multiple networks
- **Scalability**: Managing QoS for millions of flows
- **Fairness**: Balancing different users' needs
- **Economics**: Pricing models for premium services
